#  Sales Data Analytics Dashboard

##  Problem Statement
Businesses collect large volumes of sales data from multiple regions and product categories.  
Analyzing this data manually in spreadsheets is time-consuming and error-prone.  
Managers need a quick, interactive way to visualize KPIs such as **Revenue**, **Orders**, **Average Order Value**, and **Top Products**.

- Cleans and preprocesses raw sales data
- Computes key business metrics (KPIs)
- Visualizes trends (monthly revenue, regional performance, top products)
- Allows filtering by date, region, and category
- Enables CSV export of filtered data

---

##  Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Plotly, Streamlit, OpenPyXL  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, VS Code  
- **Deployment:** Streamlit Cloud / Render
